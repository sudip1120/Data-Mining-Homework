## 1. List 3 things that you learned from this podcast?

#### Answer: I have learned a lot from this podcast. Below is the list of things I have learned.

1. Importance of coding as a group. In Github, Here's a whole lot of team dynamics and programming. And then there are these roles that are like developer, evangelists, which sounds pretty similar to what I was expecting, like community outreach on the dev side, which is very social, and outgoing, and interesting. I hope it will be a lot of fun.  

2. The patient is the key of success. I just have to have faith that I'm just gonna keep cranking on the details until something interesting happens.

3. Sanyam talked about the benefit of having a large focus. Sometimes it is normal to feel disconnected. But in the end, all the acquired knowledge will help him to be a successful data analyst.

## 2. What is your reaction to the podcast? Pick at least one point Sanyam brought up in the interview that you agree with and list your reason why.

#### Answer: I am happy to listen to this podcast. It helped me to boost up my inspiration to be a data analyst. I always feel like I am not a good programmer. Sanyam makes me believe that I don't have to be good at every coding language. Also, he inspired me to participate in different coding competitions. Also, it is not important to win competitions. Through participation, I can learn a lot of things.   

##  3. After listening to the podcast, do you think you are more interested or less interested in a career in Data Science?

#### Answer: I was a data analyst before I join the Master's program. But I was not sure about staying in this field. Because I did not have much confidence in my programming skill. But after this video, I get new hope. I found a way to be a successful data analyst.
